# Machine_Learning

The files in this folder are categorized into two categories:
- Machine Learning Comparison: Including all the files related to my work on comparing different machine learning alrogithms and tuning their parameters to diagnose Diabetic Retinophaty. This work resulted in 2 conference papers (1 poster paper in Pittsburgh, USA, and 1 presentation in Mashhad, Iran). Each file is related to one specific machine learning algorithm. The structure of all the files are similar, with some changes depending on the approach.

- Pretrained Networks - DR: In this work I have used the Matlab ( .m) file to perform data augmentation on the Kaggle DR image dataset. Then the preprocess.py file will perform preprocessing on the images. The inception_finetune.py will fine-tune two pre-trained networks with the Kaggle dataset. The result is the effect of fine-tuning on DR screening and has been accepted for presentation in a conference in Tehran, Iran. The clinical study results is submitted as a journal manuscript.
